/**
 * Kotlin binding for the language-agnostic constant resolver (#2391 core).
 *
 * Supplies the two Kotlin-specific pieces the shared fold in
 * `constant-resolver.ts` needs — {@link resolveKotlinImport} (import specifier →
 * file, honoring JVM package rules) and {@link extractKotlinModuleConstants}
 * (tree → {@link ModuleConstants}) — plus a pre-bound
 * {@link resolveKotlinConstant} wrapper so callers stay language-oblivious. The
 * reusable fold, the cycle guard, and the depth cap all live in the agnostic
 * core.
 *
 * Kotlin shares the JVM package/import model with Java, so this binding mirrors
 * `java-const-resolver.ts` in structure, naming and skip-floor discipline. The
 * four places Kotlin genuinely differs are handled explicitly, not translated:
 *
 *  1. **Where a constant can live.** Java has one carrier (`static final` on a
 *     type). Kotlin has three: a top-level `const val`/`val`, a member of an
 *     `object`, and a member of a `companion object` — the last is referenced
 *     through its ENCLOSING class (`Holder.NAME`), not through `Companion`.
 *  2. **No `String` type gate.** Kotlin infers property types, so
 *     `const val ORDERS = "/orders"` carries no type node to check. The
 *     initializer decides: anything {@link parseKotlinConstOperands} cannot fold
 *     to a string (a number, a call, a template) drops the constant.
 *  3. **File names are free.** `object ApiPaths` may live in `Constants.kt`, so
 *     a `<package>/<Name>.kt` lookup is a convention, not a rule — see
 *     {@link resolveKotlinImport}'s second tier.
 *  4. **Member imports are unmarked.** Java spells them `import static a.b.C.F`;
 *     Kotlin writes `import a.b.C.F`, which is byte-identical to a type import
 *     of a class `F` in package `a.b.C`. Nothing in the syntax says which, so
 *     the fold tries both readings (see `resolveImportedName`) instead of
 *     guessing from casing.
 *
 * Constant shapes this binding harvests:
 *
 *   const val TOP_LEVEL = "/api/v1"          // file top level
 *   object ApiPaths {                        // object member
 *       const val BASE = "/api/v1"
 *       val ORDERS = BASE + "/orders"
 *   }
 *   class Holder { companion object { const val H = "/h" } }   // → Holder.H
 *
 * Reference shapes at annotation sites this binding resolves:
 *   @PostMapping(ApiPaths.ORDERS)                      // qualified
 *   @PostMapping(com.example.app.api.ApiPaths.ORDERS)  // FQN-qualified
 *   @PostMapping(ORDERS)                               // single-name import
 *   @PostMapping(ApiPaths.BASE + "/orders")            // inline concat
 *
 * Which ANNOTATIONS count as routes is a separate question this module has no
 * say in — `spring-shared.ts` owns that map. Folding and annotation recognition
 * compose; neither implies the other.
 *
 * Keying (parity with the Java and Python bindings): the repo map is keyed by
 * unique POSIX file path, and an import that cannot be pinned to exactly one
 * file returns null (skip floor), never a wrong path. A missing route is a
 * missing fact; a wrongly folded one is a false edge in the graph.
 *
 * WHERE THIS IS WIRED. Java reaches its binding from BOTH layers: the group
 * extractor (`group/extractors/http-patterns/java.ts`) and the ingestion
 * provider (`languages/java.ts`, via `extractModuleConstants` +
 * `foldRoutePathOperands`). Kotlin is wired into the GROUP layer only, because
 * the ingestion fold in `pipeline-phases/parse-impl.ts` runs exclusively over
 * `decoratorRoutes` — and `languages/kotlin.ts` declares no
 * `extractDecoratorRoutes`, since the ingestion Spring extractor (`spring.ts`)
 * is bound to `tree-sitter-java` and its node types. Declaring the constant
 * hooks on the Kotlin provider today would harvest a map on every Kotlin file
 * that nothing consumes. An ingestion-side Kotlin route extractor is the
 * prerequisite; when it lands, this binding is what its provider hooks should
 * point at, and no change here is needed.

 *  - an `object` (or `companion object`) declaration together with a `val NAME =`
 *    binding. A non-`const` `val` is the other half of the extractor's input and
 *    carries no keyword of its own; requiring an `object` nearby keeps a file
 *    whose only `val`s are function locals from costing a parse. It still admits

/**
 * The Kotlin {@link ImportResolver}: map a fully-qualified import specifier to
 * the unique file key it refers to, or null when it cannot be pinned to exactly
 * one file.
 *
 * Two tiers, tried in order, each "unique or nothing":
 *
 *  1. **File named after the declaration** — `com.example.app.api.ApiPaths` →
 *     the file ending `com/example/app/api/ApiPaths.kt`. This is the JVM
 *     convention Java can rely on outright, and it is what Kotlin projects
 *     overwhelmingly do.
 *  2. **Package directory** — Kotlin does NOT require the file name to match the
 *     declaration (`object ApiPaths` may live in `Constants.kt`) or, strictly,
 *     the directory to match the package. When tier 1 finds nothing, fall back
 *     to the unique Kotlin file sitting directly in `com/example/app/api/`. The
 *     candidate set the fold passes in is the constant-DEFINING files only, so
 *     "unique file in this package" is a far tighter question than it sounds;
 *     when 2+ files in the package define constants, this returns null and the
 *     fold floors to skip.
 *
 * Tier 2 can hand back a file that does not declare the wanted name at all. That
 * is safe by construction: the fold then looks the name up in that file's map,
 * misses, and returns null. It cannot invent a value — the worst case is a
 * skipped route.
 *
 * A "nearest shared directory" tie-break is deliberately NOT applied when a tier
 * has several candidates, for the reason the Java binding records: the JVM
 * resolves duplicate FQNs by classpath order, not directory proximity, so a test
 * fixture copy sitting closer in the tree can outrank the real dependency and
 * yield a silently wrong literal. In a resolver whose whole contract is
 * skip-or-correct, a plausible guess is the one answer that cannot be allowed.

 *    children include an interpolation alongside the `string_content` runs.
 *    Joining the content runs would silently DELETE the interpolated part and
 *    publish `/orders` — a path the application does not serve. Any named child

 *    grammar that splits escape sequences into their own nodes: it would floor
 *    to skip, never to a de-escaped path.)
 *  - **Multi-line raw strings.** A single-line `"""/api"""` is exact — unlike a
 *    Java text block, a Kotlin raw string performs no escape processing and no
 *    incidental-indentation stripping, so it folds to precisely its content. A
 *    multi-line one carries newlines (and usually a `.trimIndent()` call this
